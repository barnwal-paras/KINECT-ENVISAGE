*Change Password*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Given below a simple example to change password.
[source,C#]

NOTE: Sub Account is subclass of Account so it will contain all the methods of Account.

*Getting Sub Account List*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
GetSubAccountList will return  list of SubAccount .
[source,C#]
----------------------
 List<SubAccount> subaccounts = akount.GetSubAccountList();
----------------------

*SubAccount*

|Mute    |Either true or flase. Setting value of this parameter to true will mute the call. Setting value of this parameter to false will unmute the call.
|=======================
[source,C#]
-----------------
 var parameterlist = new Dictionary<string, string>();

To know more about StatusCallback visit this http://documentation.telestax.com/connect/api/calls-api.html#statuscallbackevent[link]

A simple example to add parameter ,make call and access call properties.
[source,C#]
-----
 var OutBCall = akount.MakeCall("+16175551212", "client:client_name", "http://cloud.restcomm.com/restcomm/demos/hello-play.xml"); 
 
 OutBCall.AddParameter("Timeout", "15"); 
 
 Console.WriteLine(call.Properties.sid);
-----


To make call to sip client
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 [source,C#]
 --------------------
 var OutBCall = akount.MakeCall("+16175551212", "sip:alice@cloud.restcomm.com", "http://cloud.restcomm.com/restcomm/demos/hello-play.xml"); 
 Call call=OutBCall.call();
 --------------------
 
NOTE: If you want to make a call to a DID number, you must can connect Restcomm to a DID provisioning service provider. The quickest way is to use RestComm AMI on Amazon Cloud. Get a list of all available calls. This will return all the available calls linked to the account SID .

TIP:  any call which is currently ringing within a Dial verb is in-progress from the point of view of Restcomm, and thus you must use 'Status=completed' to cancel it.

|ParentCallSid	|Only show calls spawned by the call with this Sid.

|=======================

*Filter using the From parameter*
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The example below will return call from client alice.

callInit.AddSearchFilter("From","alice");
List<Call> calllist= callInit.Search();

*Application*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An Application instance resource represents a RCML set of instructions used by a RestComm interpreter to process an on-going call, SMS or USSD.
RestComm stores only part of the metadata for this Application, which contains as one of its attributes the URL with the address of the application server where the RCML can be retrieved.
Currently there are 3 types of Applications that are supported: Voice, SMS and USSD. Each type of Application will be used by its specific interpreter.
Considering the access control executed by multi-tenancy, each Application can be created, read, updated or deleted by its owner solely. Any attempt of access to an Application using an account different than its owner will be denied.
